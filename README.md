In this project, we'll use JavaScript to enhance an interactive registration form for a fictional conference called **"FullStack Conf."**
HTML & CSS files have already been supplied and our role is to add our own JavaScript code, to make the form more user-friendly by: 
* adding customized and conditional behavior and interactivity
* validating user input and providing helpful error messages when the user enters invalid information into the form fields.

Instead of **"vanilla"** JavaScript, for this project we gonna be using the **jQuery** library. Doing so will allow: 
* Shorter and simplified syntax
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Building a strong familiarity with jQuery
